This is a college assignment where I have to make a game on battleships.
Battle Ship Game:
Game Manual: Battleship

Welcome to Battleship! In this game, you'll engage in a strategic naval battle against the computer. Your mission is to sink all of the enemy's ships before they sink yours. Let's dive into the details:

Game Objective:
Sink all of the computer's ships before they sink yours.
Game Setup:
 
Run the game.
Choose your options from the main menu:
1. New Game: Start a new game.
2. Load Game: Load a previously saved game.
3. Ruleset: Learn the rules and instructions of the game.
4. Exit the Game: Exit the game.


Gameplay:
 
You will start by placing your ships on the grid. You have two ships:

Small Ship (3 squares)
Big Ship (5 squares)
Enter the coordinates for each ship:

For the Small Ship, input vertical and horizontal coordinates within the range 0-9 and A-J, respectively.
For the Big Ship, input horizontal and vertical coordinates within the same range.
Once both players have placed their ships, the battle begins!

 

Each turn consists of:

You guessing a coordinate to attack the computer's ships.
The computer randomly selecting a coordinate to attack your ships.
If you hit an enemy ship, it will be marked with an "X". If you miss, it will be marked with "*".

The game continues until all of one player's ships are sunk.

 
Saving the Game and Load the Game:

At any point during the game, you can choose to save your progress.
Select "3" from the main menu to save the game.
The game will be saved to a file named "game_state.txt".

 
Winning the Game:

If you sink all of the computer's ships, you win!
If the computer sinks all of your ships, you lose.
 
Game Over:

Once the game ends, the final result will be displayed.
You can choose to start a new game, load a saved game, or exit the game from the main menu.
That's all you need to know to get started with Battleship! Good luck and may the best strategist win!
